## 1. Not Time Management

We aren't talking about techniques to manage time.
 - Pomodoro Technique
 - Multi-Tasking SUUUCKS
  - simultaneous, quick switching, or rapid succession
  - Goal Shifting, and Rule Activation
  - Computer RAM, Processes, Context
 - Eat the Frog

## 2. Choosing Ahead of Time What You'll Spend Time On.

What are you making time for?

What are you spending time doing?

 - Make Lists
 - Journal
 - Time Track

> Oh God theres So many things what now?!!?

**Goal**: Understand What you're even spending your time On.

## 3. Prioritization

Now that you understand all the shit you wanna do - now what?

Enter - **Prioritization**!

|                    |      Urgent     |     Not Urgent    |
| :----------------- | :-------------  | :---------------- |
| **Important**      | DO IT (Frogs)   | Schedule          |      
| **Unimportant**    | Delegate        | Delete            |  

### Story Time, Rocks, Pebbles, Sand, Beer

### 80/20 Rule, Pareto's principle

- 80% of your results, come from 20% of your actions,
   - and its inverse, 20% of "defects" cause 80% of the problems
   20% of your work, takes up 80% of your time

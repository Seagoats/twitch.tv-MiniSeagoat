" The Concept you develop about yourself that evolves over the course of your life"
 - includes aspects you had no choice in
 - includes aspects you chose

 - Endurer, perseverer

 - Soul... the immutable sameness despite other aspects of ours that change

 - a Name?
 - The BODY theory - personal identity persists because you occupy the same physical body
  - this theory isn't fool proof as science has shown us we physically replace our cells a billion times
  - the robot / android scenario
 - the Anchor of You
 - John Locke - the You is the conciousness
  - the Memory theory - personal identity exists because we retain memories of ourselves at different points, and memories are loosely connected.
  - if you can remember a memory of that person, you can maintain a link to to that person
   - but nobody remembers when we werre born /

   who do i need to be for this person

   you;re a role for somebody or something based on your skills, likes or characteristics

   David Hume - there is no You - there is no self
   its bundle of things, dna, mannerisms, thoughts, relationships
   psychological connection

  I have engineered my life for smallness
  play small, play big
  engineering your life
  truly afraid of the world if they showed themselves
    Mary williamson
    - our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond our belief
    your playing small does not serve the world
    we are meant to shine as children do
    - we give others the permission to do so too
    afaid of making others feel small
    when you play at a godlike level, you give others permission to do so

    one of the best ways to grow is to create somethign and put it out there on the internet.

    Test yourself - test your mental fortitude, put it out to the internet
    it is not the critic that counts - the credit belongs to the man in the arena.  the man who spends himself on a worthy cause.

    the critics arent in the arena - the cheap seats
    just a day
    its not a lifetime
    its every day you chose it

    the only thing worse than the pain of hardwork is the pain of regret
     - so are you gonna play small or play big and

Goals
ok guys we're gonna talk about goal setting

specifically BAD GOALS
cus those are fun to talk about.

### Examples

BAD GOALS - im gonna get 50 followers

its bad because its not clear how, what the timeline is,
or what that even means to achieve it, whats the big idea behind the goal?

I want to improve my stream quality by converting at least 1 viewer every stream into a follower.
Its better because it relates to something tangible, its specific, and measureable, and realistic

## SMART goals

## Where Does Your Support Go?

All your support gets reinvested back into the channel.  I'll be using it to pay for software, licenses, and other creative assets that I use across the platforms.  I believe in paying it forward by supporting other small creators, not just streamers.

100% of the proceeds from your support will directly contribute to a higher quality of content that hopefully can turn into more value for more people.

I believe in Earning every cheer, every sub, and every donation so your support pushes me to make sure I'm providing equal or greater value across every platform.  

Thank you for your continued support - I will do my best to live up to the kindness and generosity you show.

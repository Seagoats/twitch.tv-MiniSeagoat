Tonight was tough - I had to broach a hard subject.  Being this early on you experiment with a lot of things.  Some of them are great, others aren't.  Some start out great but lose steam over time.  It's hard to look at these things critically and ask yourself why they aren't working the way you expect them to.  Ultimately, we have to make hard decisions to maintain focus and push forward.  I am grateful for the people who've made the effort to include me.  In the same vein I think my path is different, and it took experimenting to learn that.

Today was my Birthday and the stream went really well.  I had been feeling down for awhile regarding my stream, but in a pep talk 15 mins before going live, my girlfriend helped me rediscover and realign with why I wanted to stream in the first place.  It made me realize again what the whole point of my content should be anyways.  From that I've found new energy to bring back to my content, and my stream.  Writing more and in a more loose manner has also been incredibly helpful.  I find this process of writing and uploading it to the world very freeing.  I hope I stick with this.

##### Reflections

I found myself feeling anxious and antsy at various points today.  I felt like I wanted to be productive but I just wasn't.  I think this was because I didn't know what I wanted to get done.  Thankfully, after saying that aloud to my girlfriend, we decided we'd get to work and accomplish just one specific thing each.  She did work things, and I made an IG post.  She then helped me fix up the post before making it ready to submit.  This made me feel like the day wasn't lost and it helped me feel ok about it.  I still feel like I want to accomplish more - so I started to document my plans better.  I really like uploading my notes.  In a sense, this is content too.  Hopefully I'll stick with this.

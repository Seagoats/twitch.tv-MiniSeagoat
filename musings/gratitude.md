# __Gratitude Log__

### [4/22]

#### I am grateful for...
 - A strong Monday show where I planned content, and spoke about it
 - Getting a new lease on the direction of my stream
 - always for the support of my lady

##### Reflections
 - It's been several days since I logged some gratitude.  Part of it is just ending some days really late.  Other times it's just ending the day in a less than stellar mindset to reflect.  It's important to do though, and I'm glad to be writing this now.  I realize writing is becoming more and more of a necessity in my current direction.  Because of that exercises like this that don't seem relevant on the surface are still valuable.
 - I'm glad to be moving towards a new phase of content.  It's scary that I'm staking a lot of channel growth on this new direction, but the truth I have to continually remind myself of is that I'm focused on creating value - not just friends.
 - I'm excited to start interviewing the community.  I have high hopes.

### [4/17]

#### I am grateful for...
 - Spending a good evening with my lady. Relaxing and fun. Not agonizing over work too much.
 - Taking the time to support a friend.  
 - seeing a community get some value out of my shit.

##### Reflections
 - Today really blew my mind.  Work reminded me I'm not invincible by any stretch of the imagination.  It also reminded me that sometimes I really do care about the folks I have the privilege of working with.  I'm reminded I do want to see them succeed - and that it is in my power to help with that.  
 - Something else happened tonight, my lady and I spent some time watching a community friend together.  It. Blew. My. Mind.  This person was talking about genuine growth and self-awareness that they were building, partly motivated and inspired by my own content.  This is nuts.  Here it was, a genuine example of ONE person, who found value in what I've been doing.  It gives me a lot of hope.  If ONE person can find it compelling - I have to keep going and turn that into 10. And then 100. And so on.  Even more importantly though, I have to continue learning, and disseminating, and sharing.  This is the path.  The hardest part is intentionally taking each and every step.  It's not a binary choice to be made in a single day.  It's the culmination of a lifetime of micro choices.

##### Reflections
 - this day sucked so much i didnt even write this till the day after lol... nuff said.  Stream went poorly.  I had zero energy and was really not proud of my own performance.

### [4/15]

#### I am grateful for...
 - having some tasty ramen delivered for Dinner
 - for having a really fun time playing videogames with just my lady
 - Having the fortune to still comfortably afford and buy groceries relatively safely.

##### Reflections
 - Today certainly wasn't a 10x productive day. Work had me pretty discouraged, and that ended up hurting my whole day.  It's funny how at times I feel so at odds with work.   These are the kinds of days I struggle to put in 100%.  It's because deep down I don't really believe in it.  I wish these days I could be completely and fully devoted to my own goals.  And not that of someone elses'.

### [4/14]

#### I am grateful for...
 - Today I was grateful for a tasty dinner we ordered out
 - Also that we moved some things and my GF was able to enjoy some videogames
 - Also that I had a fun night playing Payday with friends

##### Reflections
Tonight was tough - I had to broach a hard subject.  Being this early on you experiment with a lot of things.  Some of them are great, others aren't.  Some start out great but lose steam over time.  It's hard to look at these things critically and ask yourself why they aren't working the way you expect them to.  Ultimately, we have to make hard decisions to maintain focus and push forward.  I am grateful for the people who've made the effort to include me.  In the same vein I think my path is different, and it took experimenting to learn that.

### [4/13]

#### I am grateful for...
 - Today I was grateful for my GF helping me get work done
 - For her helping me figure out stream ideas
 - For her baking AMAZING BROWNIES
 - For a really tasty Dinner!
 - for a really Strong stream, with better topics and Support!

##### Reflections

Today was my Birthday and the stream went really well.  I had been feeling down for awhile regarding my stream, but in a pep talk 15 mins before going live, my girlfriend helped me rediscover and realign with why I wanted to stream in the first place.  It made me realize again what the whole point of my content should be anyways.  From that I've found new energy to bring back to my content, and my stream.  Writing more and in a more loose manner has also been incredibly helpful.  I find this process of writing and uploading it to the world very freeing.  I hope I stick with this.

### [4/12]

#### I am grateful for...
 - sleeping in peacefully and comfortably
 - going and getting a delicious bonfire burrito
 - playing and enjoying some games guilt-free in peace
 - for my girlfriend helping me make a special IG post
 - for having a clean re-organized kitchen

##### Reflections

I found myself feeling anxious and antsy at various points today.  I felt like I wanted to be productive but I just wasn't.  I think this was because I didn't know what I wanted to get done.  Thankfully, after saying that aloud to my girlfriend, we decided we'd get to work and accomplish just one specific thing each.  She did work things, and I made an IG post.  She then helped me fix up the post before making it ready to submit.  This made me feel like the day wasn't lost and it helped me feel ok about it.  I still feel like I want to accomplish more - so I started to document my plans better.  I really like uploading my notes.  In a sense, this is content too.  Hopefully I'll stick with this.

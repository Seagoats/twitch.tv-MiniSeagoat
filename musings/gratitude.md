##### Reflections

I found myself feeling anxious and antsy at various points today.  I felt like I wanted to be productive but I just wasn't.  I think this was because I didn't know what I wanted to get done.  Thankfully, after saying that aloud to my girlfriend, we decided we'd get to work and accomplish just one specific thing each.  She did work things, and I made an IG post.  She then helped me fix up the post before making it ready to submit.  This made me feel like the day wasn't lost and it helped me feel ok about it.  I still feel like I want to accomplish more - so I started to document my plans better.  I really like uploading my notes.  In a sense, this is content too.  Hopefully I'll stick with this.

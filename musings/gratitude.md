##### Reflections

Today was my Birthday and the stream went really well.  I had been feeling down for awhile regarding my stream, but in a pep talk 15 mins before going live, my girlfriend helped me rediscover and realign with why I wanted to stream in the first place.  It made me realize again what the whole point of my content should be anyways.  From that I've found new energy to bring back to my content, and my stream.  Writing more and in a more loose manner has also been incredibly helpful.  I find this process of writing and uploading it to the world very freeing.  I hope I stick with this.

##### Reflections

I found myself feeling anxious and antsy at various points today.  I felt like I wanted to be productive but I just wasn't.  I think this was because I didn't know what I wanted to get done.  Thankfully, after saying that aloud to my girlfriend, we decided we'd get to work and accomplish just one specific thing each.  She did work things, and I made an IG post.  She then helped me fix up the post before making it ready to submit.  This made me feel like the day wasn't lost and it helped me feel ok about it.  I still feel like I want to accomplish more - so I started to document my plans better.  I really like uploading my notes.  In a sense, this is content too.  Hopefully I'll stick with this.

- New Week, New Shows!

### [__This Month__ - May ]

April was a bit of a rough month.  While we found some new direction and I pulled the trigger on some scary changes, I feel like I lost sight of the "easy things".  Small organizational things like completing my weekly task list and turning around "small" stream improvements fell by the wayside and I feel like overall I got lazy when it came to those small things.  In May I want to focus on "Workflow".  I have a content strategy planned out, I know what needs to be done on a weekly basis.   This month I will focus on Workflow and making sure that I nail everything that I say I'm going to do.

May will be about **Workflow and Execution**.  Ultimately, I want to see growth again this month, and between creation, analysis, and streams, I will need a strong workflow that keeps all those disks spinning.

#### [Past Months]

##### [ April ]

 This month I want to focus on **Content**.  I want to refine my content and make it available on multiple fronts.

 Content Content Content!

 I'd like to refine my content to so that it feels consistent across platforms.  IG should be snippets and takes about subjects I talk about.  I should work with people to develop their goals and motivations.

 I think I need to do more outreach so that I can make developing other people's goals part of my content too.

### [__This Month__ - April ]

This month I want to focus on **Content**.  I want to refine my content and make it available on multiple fronts.

Content Content Content!

I'd like to refine my content to so that it feels consistent across platforms.  IG should be snippets and takes about subjects I talk about.  I should work with people to develop their goals and motivations.

I think I need to do more outreach so that I can make developing other people's goals part of my content too.
